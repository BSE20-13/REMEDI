Introduction
Mental health is mainly about the psychological well being of a person. This can be determined by many measures and also symptom observation.
Though this point is a serious matter affecting many communities people have still found it hard to access or know their mental status.
A famous saying goes “We are all mad but the level of madness matters”.
This topic covers a wide range of things that include mental disorders, treatment and also monitoring or rehabilitation.
People find it hard to access mental health services and also those who manage it is costly to hire a psychiatric to help diagnose the situation. This leads to so many uncalled for consequences like neglect,  madness, death among others.
If people are informed or know their mental status and keep track it can help to fight the effects or trade offs of not knowing.
